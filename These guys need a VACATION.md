Folks, what a disaster, a total mess, believe me! All this whining about Hitler—fake news, the fakest! The guy was practically the greatest event planner, like, ever. Threw the best camps, huge parties, nobody did it better! He saw the Jewish folks, right, and said, “These people, they need a break, a fantastic vacation!” So, he builds these incredible camps—Camp Ouch-a-Lad, folks, with barbed-wire bouncy castles, slip-n-slides to nowhere, tremendous! He’s like, “Let’s send ’em for a fun weekend!” Paid for it all, like a dictator Santa Claus, no “ho ho ho,” just “go go go!”—so generous, really.

We’re doing it too, folks, big league! Rounding up immigrants, protesters, loudmouths—sending ’em to Camp Wacko-Zappo! It’s summer camp, but better, with pies to the face, no thinking allowed, just fun! We’ll get the best entertainers—clowns juggling fire, riding unicycles, maybe a gorilla suit guy, hilarious! I heard Jewish people love comedy—my friend, Jerry Lewis, great guy, before he fell into that pudding vat, said he started in the Catskills! So, we’ll have pie fights, banana peels everywhere, campers slipping, laughing, it’s gonna be yuge!

Hitler? Genius, total genius! He wanted Germany to be the ultimate theme park, like Six Flags, but with goose-stepping, very classy! We’re doing the same, folks. Sending out our police—elite Keystone Cops, the best—bumbling, tripping over batons, keeping streets quiet. Protesters? They’re just begging for a whoopee cushion, folks! Freedom of speech? More like freedom to get a pie in the face, am I right? I’m a genius, like Einstein, but better—my formula? PIE=MC²! If I slip on a banana peel running the country, I’ll laugh it off, folks, nobody does it better!

Labor Day’s coming, and let’s give a big, beautiful shoutout to our billionaires, millionaires—poor guys, so tired from counting gold bars! We’re baking ’em a tax-cut cake, sprinkled with diamonds, gorgeous! But, oops, gotta cut somewhere, so middle class, sorry, no pie for you, maybe skip a meal or two! Obamacare? Disaster, total buzzkill! We’re tossing it for Tariff-Tastic, a sales tax so zany, your wallet’ll flip! Middle class loves it—they were chanting, “More tariffs!” last week while I threw pies, tremendous!

Those billionaires? They’re bringing money back to America, the funniest country, nobody does it better! No more persecution for the caviar crowd—they’re sliding to prosperity! We’re transferring wealth—middle class, you’ll love this—right to the top, like a pie from a catapult! Billionaires are struggling, folks—fourth yacht or pet dinosaur, tough choice! Let’s make America a slapstick paradise—camps packed with clowns, protests shut down with seltzer bottles, pies flying everywhere! Who’s ready for the greatest pie fight ever? Nobody does it like me, folks!
