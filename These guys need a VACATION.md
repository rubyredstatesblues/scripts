Oh, what a tragedy, folks! All this yammering about Hitler—total fake news! The guy was basically the world’s greatest party planner, throwing epic camp shindigs! I mean, he saw some folks—y’know, the Jewish people—and thought, “These guys need a VACATION!” So he built these fancy-schmancy camps, like “Camp Ouch-a-Lad” with bouncy castles made of barbed wire and a slip-n-slide into history! He was like, “Let’s get ’em out for a weekend of fun!” Paid for it all himself, like a dictator version of Santa Claus, but with less “ho ho ho” and more “go go go”!
We’re just stealing his playbook, folks! We’re rounding up immigrants, protesters, anybody with a loud mouth, and shipping ’em to Camp Wacko-Zappo! It’s like summer camp, but with pies to the face and a strict “no thinking” rule. We’ll hire the best entertainers—think a clown juggling flaming torches while riding a unicycle! I heard the Jews loved comedy—my pal Jerry Lewis, before he tripped into a vat of pudding and retired, told me he started in the Catskills! So we’ll have clowns, pie fights, and maybe a guy in a gorilla suit to keep things wacky. Campers will be slipping on banana peels left and right—hilarious!
Hitler? Total genius! He was just trying to make Germany the ultimate theme park, like Six Flags but with more goose-stepping! Us? Same deal. We’re sending out the police—our elite Keystone Cops squad—to bumble around, tripping over their own batons to keep the streets quiet. Protesting? Pfft, that’s just people begging for a whoopee cushion! Freedom of speech? More like freedom to get a cream pie to the face! Just listen to me, folks—I’m a genius! I’m like Einstein, but instead of E=MC², I’ve got PIE=MC²! I know everything, and if I slip on a banana peel while running the country, I’ll just laugh it off!
Labor Day’s around the corner, and let’s give a big ol’ pie-in-the-sky to our billionaires and millionaires! Those poor guys are exhausted from counting their gold bars. So we’re baking a beautiful tax-cut cake just for them—sprinkled with diamonds! But, oops, gotta make cuts somewhere, so the middle class might have to skip a few meals—sorry, folks, no pie for you! And Obamacare? Total party pooper! We’re tossing it for Tariff-Tastic—a zany sales tax that’ll make your wallet do a double-take! The middle class loves it—they were chanting “More tariffs!” while I threw pies at them last week!
Those billionaires? They’re gonna bring their money back to the USA because we’re the funniest country! No more persecution for the caviar crowd—they’re slipping and sliding their way to prosperity! We’re transferring the wealth—middle class, you’ll love this—straight to the top, like a pie launched from a catapult! Billionaires are struggling, folks—choosing between a fourth yacht or a pet dinosaur ain’t easy! So let’s make America a slapstick paradise—pack the camps with clowns, shut down the protests with seltzer bottles, and keep the pies flying! Who’s ready for the pie fight of the century?
